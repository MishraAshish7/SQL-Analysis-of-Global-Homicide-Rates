# SQL-Analysis-of-Global-Homicide-Rates

Overview:
This project explores homicide rate data across various countries and regions using SQL. By analyzing datasets containing homicide statistics, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to homicide rates over time and by different dimensions such as sex and region.

Key Analyses:

Average Homicide Rates: Calculated average homicide rates by region and year to identify trends and compare different geographical areas.

Data Filtering and Aggregation: Extracted specific records, such as rates for Singapore in 2019, and identified unique values within categorical dimensions.

Statistical Analysis: Performed standard deviation calculations to understand variability in homicide rates and assessed discrepancies between recorded rates and specified ranges.

Comparative Analysis: Compared homicide rates between male and female populations to highlight significant differences and trends.

Trend Analysis: Examined yearly trends for specific countries, including Japan, to detect upward or downward movements in homicide rates.

Correlation and Clustering: Analyzed correlations between homicide rates and various dimensions, and performed clustering to group countries with similar rates.

Methodology:
The project utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and various SQL functions to process and analyze the data. The analyses include calculating averages, identifying outliers, and transforming categorical data into numerical codes for statistical computations. The findings provide a comprehensive view of global homicide trends and disparities.

Insights:
The analysis reveals significant differences in homicide rates across different regions and sexes. It highlights notable trends and variations, providing valuable insights into patterns and potential areas of concern. The project also identifies anomalies and discrepancies in the data, contributing to a more accurate understanding of global homicide statistics.

Usage:
The SQL queries and analyses can be utilized to further explore the dataset, validate findings, or extend the analysis to additional dimensions and time periods. This project serves as a foundation for deeper investigations into homicide rates and related factors.
